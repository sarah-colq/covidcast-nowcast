    """
    Fit AR model through least squares and get sensorization value for a given date.

    This takes in a LocationSeries objects for the quantity of interest as well as a date to
    predict and some model parameters. The model is trained on all data before the specified date,
    and then the predictor at the given date is fed into the model to get the returned sensor value
    for that day.

    Missing values are imputed with mean imputation, though currently this function is called
    on data that has no nan values.

    It does not normalize the data yet.

    Parameters
    ----------
    day
        date to get sensor value for
    values
        LocationSeries containing covariate values.
    ar_size
        Order of autoregressive model.
    include_intercept
        Boolean on whether or not to include intercept.
    lambda_
        l2 regularization coefficient.
    standardize
        Boolean for whether or not to standardize the data before fitting. If True,
        include_intercept is is set to False.

    Returns
    -------
        Float value of sensor on `date`
