        Estimate the fitted parameters of the Poisson model.
        Code taken from Aaron Rumack, with minor modifications.

        We model

           log(y_t) = alpha_{wd(t)} + phi_t

        where alpha is a vector of fixed effects for each weekday. For
        identifiability, we constrain \sum alpha_j = 0, and to enforce this we set
        Sunday's fixed effect to be the negative sum of the other weekdays.


        We estimate this as a penalized Poisson GLM problem with log link. We
        rewrite the problem as

            log(y_t) = X beta + log(denominator_t)

        and set a design matrix X with one row per time point. The first six columns
        of X are weekday indicators; the remaining columns are the identity matrix,
        so that each time point gets a unique phi. Hence, the first six entries of beta
        correspond to alpha, and the remaining entries to phi.

         The penalty is on the L1 norm of third differences of phi (so the third
        differences of the corresponding columns of beta), to enforce smoothness.
        Third differences ensure smoothness without removing peaks or valleys.

        Return a matrix of parameters: the entire vector of betas, for each time
        series column in the data.

            sig: signal to adjust, array
